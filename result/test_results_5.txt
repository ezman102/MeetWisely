[Speaker 1] Thanks for joining. Let's sync on the release blockers. First, mobile crashes on login.
[Speaker 2] Yes, we traced it to a null token on Android. A patch is ready and will be deployed tonight.
[Speaker 3] I'll verify it on staging and flag if anything fails.
[Speaker 4] On iOS, we had an auth redirect bug, fixed and in review.
[Speaker 1] Excellent. Now, what about the new onboarding flow?
[Speaker 2] Copy updates are finalized. Waiting on final graphics from design.
[Speaker 3] Design assets will be shared by EOD.
[Speaker 4] Do we plan to A-B test it before full rollout?
[Speaker 1] Yes, let's do a 50-50 split starting next Monday.
[Speaker 2] Got it. I'll prep the experiment config and send it for QA.
[Speaker 3] Marketing also asked for early access. Should we whitelist them?
[Speaker 4] Makes sense. I'll handle that from back end.
[Speaker 1] Great. Let's aim to close all items by this Friday.

[Speaker 1] Merci de nous joindre. Synchronisons sur les bloqueurs de version. D'abord, le mobile s'écrase sur la connexion. 
[Speaker 2] Oui, nous l'avons tracé sur un jeton tout à fait sur Android. Un patch est prêt et sera déployé ce soir. 
[Speaker 3] Je le vérifierai sur la mise en scène et le drapeau si quelque chose échoue. 
[Speaker 4] Sur iOS, nous avons eu un bug direct, corrigé et en revue. 
[Speaker 1] Excellent. Maintenant, qu'en est-il du nouveau flux d'embarquement? 
[Speaker 2] Les mises à jour de copie sont finalisées. Attendons sur les graphiques finaux de la conception. 
[Speaker 3] Les actifs de conception seront partagés par EOD. 
[Speaker 4] Préparons-nous de le tester A-B avant 4 lignes? 
[Speaker 1] Oui, faisons un 50-50 fractionnement à partir de lundi prochain. 
[Speaker 2] Je vais préparer la config d'expérience et l'envoyer pour QA. 
[Speaker 3] Marketing a également demandé un accès précoce. Devrions-nous les lister?
